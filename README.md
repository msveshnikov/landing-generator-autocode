# Landing Page Generator

## Overview

This project is a Landing Page Generator that allows users to create custom landing pages by
selecting design types, colors, hero image URLs, and other imagery. Users can also provide a brief
product description. The generator uses the Sonnet 3.5 model to create an `index.html` file, which
is then displayed in an iframe and available for download. Users can iteratively improve the
generated page with additional instructions until they are satisfied. Works fully in browser.
